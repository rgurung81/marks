# marks

Write a code in Python for student result processing for a school. You have marks obtained by a student in 5 subjects.  
Write 3 different functions:                 
1. CalculateSum(): this find out sum of all those numbers.
2. CalculatePercent(): this find out % marks.
3. CalculateResult(): this will find out whether the student passed or failed.

   Condition for pass or fail is:
    1. If student got < 40 in any subject, then failed.
    2. 2. If student total % is less than 40 % then failed.
Result format:

Marks in 5 subjects :N1, N2,N3,N4,N5.                                                                       % marks: X%.                                                                                                          

Final result: Pass or Fail
